# Cardano Starter Kit #005
## The Gimbalabs Local ADA Spending Challenge

This is our first collaborative CSK and the first one where we're sending you out into the world on a mission. To commemorate it, we're going to mint 25 special NAME? tokens when Mary goes live in late-January or early-February! Today, we'll take a look at the Mary testnet and outline the challenge. All sorts of new structures here from the video to how we hope you'll engage

- [Challenge Description]()


### Why did we make this challenge?
1. Show what native tokens look like on Mary
2. Engage locally - how we can so far
3. Demonstrate usage of native token when Mary hits
4. STORYTELLING: Gather and share some stories - we'll present these on a web site, etc

### Intended Audience
You should take a look at this starter kit if you're curious about what the backend looks like or if you want to be part of the historic roll out of Cardano

### Learning Targets
1. I have an idea of what native tokens and token bundles will look like on Cardano.
2. I can make a plan and drive adoption of Cardano by spending ADA in my community.

### Outcomes
1. Have some ideas, including testing Proto
2. Go spend some ADA!

### Documents
- Planning Worksheet [make a copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zE95LY1sQMd6kpIVY0G3ZwCE1yCtA5Il4i9HhU8MVIo/copy)
- Merchant Worksheet [make a copy and prep for use](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVs80lpFzCXDZTfCGMVISWRyKtGatVKT0bsrSVmanh4/edit) - note that the Cardano logo is there just so the merchant can get to know the brand. Feel free to delete it or add your logo if that feels right.
- Submission guidelines (2nd page of planning doc, or separate?)

### Submission Instructions
- When you've successfully spent some ADA in your community, please [fill out this form to tell us about your success!](https://lkj3u1s1jd5.typeform.com/to/NDRtQV5m)

### Files
- csk-minter.sh
- send-token.sh
- burn-token.sh

We are including these files for your reference. In order to use these scripts you'll need to have a passive node running on Cardano's Launchpad ([see configuration files here](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/5102327/download/1/index.html)). If this is the sort of thing you'd like to learn more about, try [reading the official docs](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/index.html). We are considering running a live workshop for people who want to tinker with a Cardano node without running stake pool - if that's you, be in touch!

### Extension
- Want to know more about what's going on here? Read through the .sh files linked here, the Cardano Docs (link) and complete this Shell Scripting Tutorial (https://www.shellscript.sh/index.html) -- see how much makes sense.
- Passive node: a step toward running a stake pool, where you can play with the blockchain - especially if you're on a testnet. Need help with this part? Reach out!
