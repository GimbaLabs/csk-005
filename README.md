# Cardano Starter Kit #005
## Local ADA Spending Challenge

This is our first collaborative CSK and the first one where we're sending you out into the world on a mission. To commemorate it, we're going to mint 25 special NAME? tokens when Mary goes live in late-January or early-February! Today, we'll take a look at the Mary testnet and outline the challenge


### Intended Audience
You should take a look at this starter kit if you're curious about what the backend looks like or if you want to be part of the historic roll out of Cardano

### Learning Targets
1. I have an idea of what native tokens and token bundles will look like on Cardano.
2. I can make a plan and drive adoption of Cardano by spending ADA in my community.

### Outcomes
1. Have some ideas, including testing Proto
2. Go spend some ADA!
